## UX

### Project Goal

The main objective in creating Simon Game! is to provide the user with a minimalistic, easy to use interface, while providing 
different levels of difficulty for the more advanced players. 

This game is design with all users in mind, from children to adults, and tries to account for the train of thought from all age groups.

#### Development Goals

- A project I'd be excited to show off to people as a testament to my abilities. 
- Well thought out programming to account for the unpredictability of users both young and old. 
- Something that looked professional even for a novice programmer on their first venture in JavaScript and jQuery. 

### Wireframes

The below wireframes are bundled together into one file, but were created both by hand to show some of the thought process, 
then upscaled by hand into Visio.
